Here is a list of the changes I made: 

Changed if name not equal to EOFNAME to while name <> EOFNAME: The condition should be part of a while loop to continue until the user enters the EOF name.
Changed not equal to to <>: For clarity and consistency in pseudocode.
Repositioned the while loop: The while loop was moved around the entire input section to handle multiple employees and terminate properly when EOFNAME is entered.
Fixed the endwhile statement: Correct placement after the loop logic.
Added endif after the if-else block to properly close the condition.
