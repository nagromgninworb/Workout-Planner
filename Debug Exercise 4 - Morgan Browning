Here is a list of the changes I made: 

Changed input mtgPayment to input mortgagePayment to ensure the variable names are consistent.
Modified input mortgagePayment in startUp() to correctly capture the mortgage payment.
Ensured function names and variable names were consistent: mortgagePayment was used consistently across all sections (it was inconsistent with mtgPayment in the startUp() function).
Updated while loop to use <> for "not equal to" to make the condition clearer.
